## ScrollDID

ScrollDID is s a W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifier (DID) solution tailored for the healthcare sector. It leverages state-of-the-art decentralized cryptography for identity-based encryption and signing of healthcare data, ensuring maximum security and user control.

## Key Features:

Decentralized Cryptography: At the heart of ScrollDID is a state-of-the-art decentralized cryptographic system. This ensures that healthcare data is not only encrypted but also signed in a manner that is distributed, making it resilient against breaches and single points of failure.

Machine Readable Format: Follow International standards namely fhir and HL7

Identity-Based Encryption: ScrollDID employs identity-based encryption, allowing healthcare data to be encrypted directly to an individual's identity. This means that only the intended recipient, who has the correct identity credentials, can decrypt and access the data.

Data Resolver: Beyond just encryption and signing, ScrollDID acts as a resolver for users' healthcare data. In essence, it serves as a secure directory, guiding authorized entities to the correct location of a user's data without exposing sensitive information.

Full User Control: One of the standout features of did:health is the empowerment of users. Individuals have complete control over their identity and associated data. They can dictate who has access to their data, set permissions, and even revoke access when necessary.

## Benefits:

Enhanced Security: By decentralizing the cryptographic processes, ScrollDID minimizes vulnerabilities associated with centralized systems.

User-Centric Privacy: Users no longer have to rely on third parties to safeguard their data. They have the tools and authority to manage their data privacy directly.

Interoperability: Being built on W3C's DID standards, did:health is designed to be interoperable with other systems, ensuring a seamless experience for users and healthcare providers alike.

Transparency and Trust: With the decentralized nature of the system, all operations are transparent, fostering trust among users and stakeholders.
